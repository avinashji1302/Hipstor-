# Hipstor Assignment

A simple and responsive Flutter application that displays a paginated list of employees fetched from a gievn API. Users can view employee details and the last opened employee is saved and displayed at the top of the list using shared Preference.


## Getting Started

## ðŸ”§ How to Run the App

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee_directory_app.git
   cd employee_directory_app

2. **Insatll The Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
## Approach:
   
Pagination
The app fetches employee data from:
https://fake-json-api.mock.beeceptor.com/users?_page=1&_limit=10

It implements infinite scrolling pagination using a ScrollController.

When the user scrolls near the bottom, the next page is automatically fetched.

State Management
The app uses GetX (get package) for:

Controller-based logic

Reactive state updates using Rx variables

Navigation between pages

Local Storage
The last opened employee's data is stored using shared_preferences as a JSON string.

When the app launches, the last opened employee is displayed at the top of the list (without duplication).
